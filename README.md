# Remote-ETC-control-via-CAN
Controller Area Network (CAN) is a multi-master priority based serial communication protocol for connecting two or more ECU’s. CAN network has 2 parts- Part A- data communication using 11-bit message ID known as standard format and Part-B – Data communication using 29-bit message ID known as extended format. This lab was performed to develop a remote electronic throttle control using CAN communication between two ECU’s using standard data format. Sensors inputs and actuation signals were communicated between the two ECU’s. Two message definition files were generated for the two message files to be transmitted between ECU’s to define the message ID, endianness, payload size, ID filter and scale/offset of payload. The CAN bus was monitored in the CANKing output window.
